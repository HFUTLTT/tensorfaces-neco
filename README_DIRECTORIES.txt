components:
Tensor components and weights created by decomposing a set if face images using makeTensorFaces.m. Each component image is 200x200x3, where 200 is number of pixels, and 3 is the color channels.
faces:
Set of faces serving as inputs to the tensor decomposition algorithm. These are in Matlab .mat format. Each face image is 200x200x3, where 200 is number of pixels, and 3 is the color channels.
